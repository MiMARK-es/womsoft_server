# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the WomSoft Server project.

## Testing Goals

1. Ensure software correctness and reliability
2. Validate that the software meets specified requirements
3. Verify risk controls are implemented and effective
4. Provide evidence for regulatory compliance

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual functions and methods
- **Technology**: Pytest
- **Coverage Target**: >80% code coverage
- **Location**: `tests/unit/`
- **Execution**: Automated in CI/CD pipeline

### Integration Testing

- **Scope**: API endpoints and service interactions
- **Technology**: Pytest with FastAPI test client
- **Coverage Target**: All API endpoints and critical workflows
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Execution**: Automated in CI/CD pipeline

### UI Testing

- **Scope**: End-to-end user workflows
- **Technology**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Coverage Target**: Key user journeys
- **Location**: `tests/ui/`
- **Execution**: Automated in Docker Selenium environment

### Manual Testing

- **Scope**: User experience and edge cases
- **Strategy**: Scripted test cases following test plan
- **Documentation**: Test results stored in QMS
- **Execution**: Before each release

## Test Data Management

- **Test Data Generation**: Programmatically generated in test fixtures
- **Reference Data Sets**: <!-- TODO: Describe reference data sets -->
- **Sensitive Data**: No production or personal data used in testing

## Risk-Based Testing

Testing prioritization is aligned with risk assessment:

1. **High-Risk Areas**: 
   - Diagnostic calculation algorithms
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data integrity

2. **Medium-Risk Areas**:
   - User interface functionality
   - Data validation

3. **Low-Risk Areas**:
   - Cosmetic UI elements
   - Non-critical administrative functions

## Test Environment Management

- **Development**: Local developer machines or containerized environments
- **Testing**: Isolated Docker environment
- **Staging**: Environment matching production configuration
- **Production**: Validated deployment environment

## Relationship to V&V Plan

This testing strategy implements the technical aspects of the V&V Plan documented in the QMS:
- Document ID: <!-- TODO: Add V&V Plan document ID -->

## Traceability

Test cases are traced to:
- Software requirements
- Risk controls
- User needs

For traceability matrix, refer to the V&V documentation in the QMS.
