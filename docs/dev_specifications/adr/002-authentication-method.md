# Architecture Decision Record: Authentication Method

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The WomSoft Server application requires a secure authentication mechanism for users. We needed to select an appropriate authentication method that provides security while maintaining usability and supporting our application architecture.

## Decision
We will implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication.

## Rationale
- **Statelessness**: JWTs are self-contained and don't require server-side session storage
- **Scalability**: Works well with our architecture and can scale horizontally
- **Security**: Supports secure transmission of user information
- **Flexibility**: Can include custom claims and metadata
- **Standard**: Uses established security standards with wide library support
- **Cross-domain**: Works well across different domains and microservices if needed in the future

## Consequences
### Positive
- No need for session database, reducing complexity
- Reduced server load for authentication verification
- Easy to integrate with FastAPI framework
- Supports future extensions and microservices architecture

### Negative
- Tokens cannot be invalidated before expiry (mitigated with short-lived tokens)
- Token size increases with claim information
- Requires secure storage in the client application

### Mitigations
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Set appropriate token expiration times (short-lived access tokens)
- Store tokens securely using HttpOnly cookies with Secure flag
- Implement a token blacklist for critical logout scenarios

## Implementation Details
- Access tokens will have a short lifespan (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens will have a longer lifespan (7 days)
- Token validation will occur on every protected API request
- Role-based access control will be encoded in token claims
