# Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards for the WomSoft Server project.

## Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Variable names: lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- Class names: CamelCase
- Constants: UPPERCASE with underscores

## Documentation

- All functions should have docstrings explaining parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Complex algorithms should include inline comments explaining logic
- Include references to relevant requirements and risk controls when implementing critical features

## Testing

- All new features should include unit tests
- Aim for minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical calculations and risk controls require more comprehensive testing

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types over generic ones
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Validate all user inputs
- Always provide meaningful error messages

## Security Practices

- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Version Control

- Use descriptive branch names (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/ prefixes)
- Keep commits small and focused
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Include issue/ticket number in commit messages

## Code Review Checklist

- Code follows style guide
- Tests are included and passing
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Error handling is appropriate
- Security considerations are addressed
- Performance implications have been considered
